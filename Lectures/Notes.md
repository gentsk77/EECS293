### Iterative vs Sequential development 

**Sequential** 
- could somehow jump directly to a solution
- major steps: requirement development -> construction planning -> software architecture -> unit testing -> integration testing etc. 

**Iterative**
- more flexible way 
- define problem first
- resent prototype that demo only parts of the features
- eg: airport prototypes w/o sbux
- major stpes: similar to pure sequential, though in iterative mannar 

Makes adjustments in timely mannar 

### Problem Definition

A short description of what **problem** your software will solve. 

Differentiate: when it is delivered, it seems to be a concise and simple statement of your solution to the problem. 

eg: when asked about a problem, people tends to describe possible solutions rather than the prolbem itself. Transportation vs Automobiles
